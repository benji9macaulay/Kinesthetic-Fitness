The body-weight exercise known as Burpees or "Kiss my Black A$$(KMBAs)" was used to observe blood pressure and determine whether 9 sets of 10 repetitions daily, could improve cardiovascular fitness for anyone intereseted in maintaining healthy weight. For 31 days I observed my blood pressure before and after the 90 KMBAs, the pulse rates, the overall clock time it took to get the 90 reps done, and the hour of the day (AM or PM). For instructional purposes, I have included a visual of the actual exercise through the link below.
